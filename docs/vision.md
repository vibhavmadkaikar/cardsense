# CardSense – Product Vision

**Tagline:**  
Smarter decisions for every card you use.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Modern users own multiple cards:

- Credit cards from different banks
- Debit cards with cashback or offers
- Co-branded and lifestyle cards

Each card has:

- Different reward rules
- Category-based benefits
- Billing cycles and due dates
- Hidden exclusions and caps

Users struggle to:

- Decide which card to use for a purchase
- Track rewards and benefits accurately
- Avoid late payments
- Fully utilize card perks

There is no simple, unified system that helps users **make the best card decision at the moment of spending**.

---

## 2. Vision

CardSense aims to become a **personal card intelligence layer** that helps users:

- Manage all cards in one place
- Track spending clearly and reliably
- Understand card benefits without reading fine print
- Know _which card to use_ before making a payment
- Never miss a due date

The long-term goal is to move from **manual tracking** to **smart, automated decision-making**.

---

## 3. Target Users

### Primary Users

- Salaried professionals with 2+ cards
- Tech-savvy users who care about rewards & optimization
- Users who manually track spends today (Excel, notes, apps)

### Secondary Users (Future)

- Freelancers and self-employed users
- Heavy spenders focused on travel & lifestyle benefits
- Users with RuPay cards and UPI-linked credit cards

---

## 4. Core Principles

1. **Clarity over complexity**

   - Simple UI
   - Clear explanations
   - No financial jargon without context

2. **Data-driven decisions**

   - Rewards and benefits should be calculated, not guessed
   - Rules live in data, not hardcoded logic

3. **Privacy-first**

   - No bank credentials stored
   - Manual or user-approved data ingestion only

4. **Progressive intelligence**
   - Start rule-based
   - Evolve to AI-assisted recommendations later
